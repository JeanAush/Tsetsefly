      <h1> Tsetse distribution System</h1>
      <p>
        The TseTse distribution System is a comprehensive solution designed to
        monitor and manage the distribution of tsetse flies. Tsetse flies are
        significant vectors of diseases, particularly in livestock, posing a
        threat to both human and animal health.
      </p>
      <h2>What is the TseTse distribution system?</h2>
      <p>
        Tsetse flies are known vectors of diseases affecting both humans and
        animals. Our system provides a user-friendly platform for researchers to
        analyze and visualize tsetse fly data, contributing valuable insights
        for disease control strategies.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h2>How it benefits researchers</h2>
      <p>
        Researchers play a crucial role in disease control and prevention. The
        TseTse Control System empowers researchers by providing them with a
        comprehensive tool to study, monitor, and analyze tsetse fly
        populations. The data generated aids in informed decision-making for
        effective disease management.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to support researchers in their efforts to combat
        diseases transmitted by tsetse flies. By providing a powerful yet
        accessible platform, we aim to contribute to advancements in disease
        control strategies and ultimately improve global health outcomes.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        To develop a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for studying and
        analyzing the distribution of tsetse flies. By leveraging modern
        technology and data analysis tools, the project aims to provide
        researchers and scientists with valuable insights into the spatial
        distribution, behavior, and prevalence of tsetse flies.
